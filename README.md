# Assement Text adventure

> This is the TAS assessment task :)

## How to play?

- Run app.py or Terminal.py
- Select a map
- Input your action into the box and press enter
- You can do any action you want!*
- If at any time you want to save/load your adventure choose your save slot and press save/load
- If you want to repeat an action you can press the back arrow and it will go back to your previous action
- Certain Functions might be spefic so rember to read all of the instructions
- Don't get frustrated if you can't complete a puzzle don't worry as most of the time you will get it with a bit of patience.
- If you get into a battle than you need to read all of the stats of your enemies, but a reminder that you cannot leave the room during a battle
*Most things
(This is not in order)

## MUST DO

- ## **MAKE THE POSTER** (individually)

- ### **make a video demonstration** (Riley was working on the script)

- ## Make sure everything works properly. To do that we need to make a new release soon (maybe once we are done?)
- Agreed - Riley =)
